# fun-fusion

**Overview**

Fun-fusion is a delightful web application designed to bring a little bit of joy into your everyday routine. Whether you need a laugh, a fun fact, or some trivia, this app has you covered! Users can explore a random assortment of jokes, cat facts, book recommendations, and even NBA team trivia to brighten their day.

This project is meant to be good practice for Noroff front-end students looking to hone their skills in collaboration, API integration, responsive design, and user experience. The goal is to create a simple yet engaging app that delivers fun and informative content to users in an easy-to-digest format.

**Contributing**

If you are studying front end development at Noroff, we welcome your contributions to this project! Here’s a simple guide on how we can work together effectively:

<br><br>

1. Communication is Key
   
   Get in Touch: send me (Maddie) a DM on teams, or get in touch on the FEDAUG23 discord channel _fun-fusion_ if you're there, and I'll add you to the Figma team for design planning as well as the project board.

   Discuss Before You Start: Before starting on a new feature or making significant changes, check the project board. This helps avoid overlapping work and ensures everyone is on the same page.
   You can find tasks that no one is working on and assign yourself, or add new tasks. Link the appropriate issues and PRs to the board to keep everything organised.

<br><br>

2. Use Git Branches
   
   Create Feature Branches: Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you’re working on. Name it descriptively (e.g., feature/user-login or bugfix/navbar-alignment).
   Keep main Stable: Avoid pushing directly to the main branch. This branch should always contain stable, working code.

<br><br>

3. Submit Pull Requests
   
   Create a Pull Request (PR): Once you’ve finished working on a feature or fix, create a pull request to merge your branch into main. Provide a clear description of what you’ve done.
   Request Reviews: Ask at least one other team member to review your code before merging. They can help catch issues and suggest improvements.
   Address Feedback: Be open to feedback and make any necessary changes. Collaboration is about learning and improving together!

<br><br>

4. Manual Code Reviews
   
   Review Code Carefully: When reviewing someone else’s pull request, take the time to read through their changes. Look for potential issues and ensure the code follows our agreed-upon practices.
   Leave Constructive Comments: If you see something that could be improved, leave a constructive comment. Focus on how the code can be better, not just on what’s wrong.

<br><br>

5. Manual Testing
   
   Test Your Changes: Before submitting a pull request, test your changes manually to ensure they work as expected. Run the application locally and check that the new feature or fix behaves correctly.
   Test Key Scenarios: Consider edge cases and different user scenarios when testing. This helps catch bugs that might not be immediately obvious.

<br><br>

6. Code Consistency
   
   Follow Agreed-Upon Standards: Stick to the coding conventions we’ve agreed upon, such as indentation, naming conventions, and comment usage. Consistency makes our codebase easier to read and maintain. Use the Prettier extension in VS Code.
   Document Your Code: Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic or important decisions. This helps others understand your code and makes future maintenance easier.

<br><br>

7. Keep Documentation Updated
    
   Add Instructions: If your feature requires special setup or has dependencies, add clear instructions to the documentation.

<br><br>

8. Be Respectful and Supportive
    
   Respect Each Other’s Work: Remember that everyone is contributing their time and effort to the project. Be respectful in your feedback and supportive of each other’s growth.
   Help When You Can: If a teammate is stuck or unsure about something, offer help or guidance. Collaboration is about working together to achieve our goals.

<br><br>

9. Iterate and Improve
    
   Continuous Improvement: As the project evolves, we may introduce new tools or processes to improve our workflow. Be open to trying new things and providing feedback on what works best.
   Learn Together: Use this project as an opportunity to learn from each other and grow as developers. Share your knowledge and experiences with the team.
